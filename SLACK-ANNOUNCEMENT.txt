Hi Team 👋

I've built a real-time leaderboard demo tool that any SolCon can use to make their Braze demos more interactive and engaging! 🎯

🔥 What is it?
A live leaderboard that updates in real-time (2-second refresh) whenever someone completes a quiz, game, or any scored activity. Think gamification, contests, training sessions, or interactive workshops.

✨ The best part? Everyone gets their own isolated leaderboard!
Each of you can run demos simultaneously without interfering with each other. Just pick a unique quiz_id and you're good to go.

🎮 Perfect for demo scenarios:
• Gamification use cases (loyalty programs, engagement contests)
• Interactive workshops with audience participation
• Training & onboarding with quizzes
• Event activations with live rankings
• Customer competitions

🚀 How it works:
1. Create a Braze Landing Page with your quiz/game
2. Use Agent Console to calculate scores
3. Send results via webhook to the leaderboard
4. Share the live URL with your audience
5. Watch scores update in real-time as people participate!

📱 Features:
✓ Real-time updates (no page refresh needed)
✓ Top 3 highlighted with medals and special colors
✓ Mobile responsive
✓ Each demo has its own isolated leaderboard (via quiz_id)
✓ Easy to clear between demos

🔗 Your leaderboard URL format:
https://tgt-vercel-braze-demo-leaderboard-braze.vercel.app/quiz/YOUR-QUIZ-ID

Example:

• Canvas Setup (copy/paste ready): Check the Canvas-Setup-Guide in the repo
• Database migration steps: MIGRATION-GUIDE.md

🛠️ Quick Start (5 minutes):
1. Choose a unique quiz_id (e.g., "demo-yourname-q4")
2. Create your Canvas with:
   - Landing Page for data capture
   - Agent Console to calculate score
   - Webhook to: https://tgt-vercel-braze-demo-leaderboard-braze.vercel.app/api/update-score
3. Webhook body:
   {
     "user_id": "{{${user_id}}}",
     "username": "{{${first_name}}} {{${last_name}}}",
     "score": {{canvas_entry_properties.${score}}},
     "quiz_id": "your-quiz-id"
   }
4. Share your leaderboard URL with customers!

🧹 Clear your leaderboard before demos:
https://tgt-vercel-braze-demo-leaderboard-braze.vercel.app/clear
(Enter your quiz_id to clear only YOUR leaderboard)

💡 Pro Tips:
• Pre-load 3-5 test scores before customer demos to make it look realistic
• Show the leaderboard on a second screen during live demos to highlight real-time updates
• Use it for workshop competitions - create team spirit!
• Perfect for trade shows and events with live audience participation

🎯 Example Use Cases I've Tested:
• Workshop quiz competitions (team vs team)
• Product knowledge tests for training
• Engagement campaigns with instant gratification
• Live event activations with real-time rankings

Feel free to clone my Canvas as a starting point or build your own. The system is designed to handle multiple SolCons running demos at the same time - just make sure your quiz_id is unique!

Who wants to try it first? Would love to hear your feedback and see creative use cases you come up with! 🚀

Cheers,
Thomas
